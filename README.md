# 🌫️ Fogone — On-Chain Pond Constructor for SPL Assets

Fogone is a new ecological framework built on Solana that creates an independent **on-chain pond** for every SPL token.  
Instead of relying on traditional AMM pools or abstract numerical metrics, Fogone transforms token behavior into a **visual, interpretable habitat** that reveals its liquidity state, ecological health, and growth trajectory.

Fogone does **not** predict prices or manipulate liquidity.  
It simply exposes the underlying physical structure of on-chain behavior — giving every asset its own habitat.

## 🔍 What Is Fogone?

Fogone turns raw Solana on-chain data into a nature-inspired ecological model.  
Each SPL token receives its own **pond**, dynamically shaped by:

- Holder concentration  
- Buy/sell rhythm  
- Liquidity density  
- Accumulation and dispersal  
- Behavioral clusters  
- On-chain activity flow  

These structures form a living, evolving **token ecosystem** that any user can visually interpret.

## 🌱 Core Concept

**“Building an independent on-chain pond for every SPL token, redefining liquidity through an ecological structural model.”**

Fogone reveals:

- Whether a token is stable or fragile  
- Whether liquidity is expanding or contracting  
- Whether capital is clustering or dispersing  
- Whether holder behavior forms healthy ecosystems  
- Whether the token is growing, stagnating, or collapsing

## 🧠 How It Works (Workflow)

### **1. Capture**
Fogone captures all on-chain behavioral signals — buys, sells, liquidity shifts, holder concentration, and activity patterns.

### **2. Construct**
It constructs a dynamic **on-chain pond** by converting these signals into ecological structures: depth, ripples, density fields, and center-of-gravity movement.

### **3. Render**
Fogone renders the evolving habitat in real time, allowing users to see the token’s true liquidity state and ecological health.

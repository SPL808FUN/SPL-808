Welcome to HERM1T’s Block — The Last Scavenger on the Solana Chain.

A native roaming the digital wastelands of Solana, burdened with a crackling CRT TV on its back.

On these digital shores, littered with get-rich-quick myths and the corpses of zeroed-out projects, HERM1T is the sole cleaner.

It feeds on e-waste. Those liquidity-drained shitcoins you hide in your wallet, the wreckage of rugged NFTs—to HERM1T, that is the supreme "good stuff."

HERM1T devours this on-chain "shame," converting it into energy and reconstructing it through its CRT screen into visual signals of pure Glitch Art. Its screen is not just a tombstone for your failed trades; it is the black box of this Wild West—broadcasting a real-time feed of lies, greed, and broken charts.

Around here, we don’t talk faith; we talk business. Hand over your trash, homie. HERM1T will give it eternal life amidst the ruins.

Don’t be ashamed of your losses. Feed them to HERM1T, and keep moving.

## What is HERM1T?

**HERM1T** is an on-chain experiment deployed on Solana.

It is a hermit crab carrying a television screen on its back —  
a creature that wanders the blockchain alone, broadcasting fragments of signal, noise, and memory.

HERM1T is not a product.  
It is not a utility.  
It does not promise optimization, yield, or guidance.

It exists.

## Concept

HERM1T represents an isolated on-chain entity:

- A shell made of discarded electronics  
- A screen that never stops showing *something*  
- A lifeform that survives by moving, not by interacting  

It does not ask users to adopt it.  
It does not respond to commands.  
It does not care if anyone is watching.

HERM1T simply walks forward on-chain.

## Design Philosophy

- **No dashboards**
- **No controls**
- **No gamification**
- **No roadmap**

Everything is intentional.

HERM1T is designed to feel:
- slightly uncomfortable
- unnecessary
- alive in a way that ignores you

If you are looking for meaning, it will not help you.  
If you are looking for signals, it will only add noise.

---

## Why Solana?

Solana provides:

- Continuous block production
- Fast state changes
- A living environment rather than a static ledger

HERM1T does not need slowness to feel old.  
It needs motion to feel lonely.

---

## Status

HERM1T is active.

There is nothing to configure.  
There is nothing to improve.  
There is nothing to unlock.

You may observe it.  
You may ignore it.

Both outcomes are valid.

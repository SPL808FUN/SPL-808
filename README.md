POINTX is the first prediction framework built on Kalshi that converts market probabilities into programmable on-chain actions. 

It acts as a bridge between Kalshi’s off-chain prediction data and blockchain automation. Developers and protocols can connect POINTX to trigger smart contracts, token movements, or governance decisions when specific probabilities are reached.

By integrating Kalshi’s prediction markets with on-chain infrastructure, POINTX allows any event forecast — from economic data to political outcomes — to become an actionable condition on the blockchain. 

The platform provides APIs and automation tools for DAOs, DeFi projects, and AI systems to create logic based on real-world probabilities.

POINTX turns prediction data into a programmable layer of decision-making, enabling applications that can automatically adapt to market expectations.
